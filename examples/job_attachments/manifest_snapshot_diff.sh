# This script demonstrates building on Job Attachments CLI primitives for manifest and attachment handling.
# In this example, we snapshot a directory, make a modification and diff against the snapshot to show to find what files have changed.
# This example is useful as a cron job to create incrementally updated manifests and upload only modified or new files.
###

# Snapshot the src directory
MANIFEST=$(deadline manifest snapshot --root ./src \
    --destination ~/work/manifest/ \
    --name break-time \
    --json)

###
# Output: 
# {
#   "manifest": "/Users/hello/work/manifest/breaktime-time-2024-09-17T13-57-33.manifest"
# }

# Use jq to parse the JSON output and extract the file path
FILE_PATH=$(echo "$MANIFEST" | jq -r '.manifest')

echo "Created Manifest file: $FILE_PATH"

# Simulate the addition of a new file, use the diff command to find the new or modified file
touch ./src/new.file

# Now use the diff argument to just get the new file.
DIFF_MANIFEST=$(deadline manifest snapshot --root ./src \
    --destination ~/work/manifest/ \
    --name break-time \
    --diff $FILE_PATH \
    --json)
DIFF_FILE_PATH=$(echo "$DIFF_MANIFEST" | jq -r '.manifest')
echo "Created Diff Manifest file: $DIFF_FILE_PATH"

rm ./src/new.file

# Show the diff manifest pretty printed json.
